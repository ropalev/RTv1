# RTv1
## Project objective
 Generate images according to Raytracing protocol.
## Skills to acquire and use
•	Fundamentals of C  
•	Algorithm elaboration  
•	Imperative programming  
•	Rigor  
•	Graphics  
•	Getting acquainted with the ray tracing rendering technique
## How to run it? (works on Linux)
•	git clone https://github.com/ropalev/RTv1.git «Folder name»  
•	cd «Folder name»  
•	make  
•	Run the program using executable "RTv1" and a scene description text file as an argument. (There is a special folder "scenes/" in the project repository, which contains several scenes to use)  
For example:  
```
./RTv1 scenes/scene_1
```
## What does it do?
It builds a 3D image on the screen using ray tracing rendering technique:

You can see some reclection in this scene_1. (It wasn't required for maximum score of 125)  
  
Figures can be translated and rotated (so as the camera). You can see this on scenes 7 and 8:
